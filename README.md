# MoviePoll
Application's registration and login are controlled by an Administrator account. Also, this app uses Spring security and passwords are encrypted, so you'll need to have one admin account to log in. There is MySQL dump file called "MoviePollDBDump", use it to create database and tables, and log in via - username: Admin; password: admin.
All layers are tested, except fail cases were omitted because I didn't have time to write additional fifty test cases for a practice web app.
